This project is a (work in progress) 2d platformer with quicksave support, nonlinear area transitions
with every object's state persisting between them, smooth background layers replacement behaviour,
a cool scoring system, an enemy/block/collectible behaviour editor used for easily creating complex objects
behaviour, and A LOT more. Also if you enjoy the game, consider replaying it and aiming for a higher score!
The scoring mechanics in this game were a big focus for me.
My discord nickname is Pawlogates, if you'd like to ask me something.
