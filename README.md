This project is a (work in progress) 2d platformer with quicksave support, nonlinear area transitions
with every object's state persisting between them, smooth background layers replacement behaviour, a cool scoring system,
an enemy/block/collectible behaviour editor used for easily creating complex objects behaviour, and A LOT more.
Also if you enjoy the game, consider replaying it and aiming for a higher score! The scoring mechanics in this game
were a big focus for me.

My discord nickname is Pawlogates, if you'd like to ask me something.
